# OS1: Adventure

The goal of this assignment was to play with reading and writing files using unix.

For this assignment I tried the Prototype-first method.

## Some notes on using Prototype-first method

I used the prototype-first method for building this assignment.
I drafted the solution in a seperate prototype.py and ported the app to c.

I followed the prototype-first method for the following reasons:

* I've never used the prototype-first method and I wanted to try it
* I have more practice in python than in c so I wanted to think through the problem in a familiar language
* The spec was clear and static
* This assignment had basically two parts:
- Figuring out the solution
- Figuring out how to actually write the solution in c
 (so it makes sense to figure out the solution in a higher-level language)

How I felt about the prototype-first method:

 Overall it felt longer, but I liked it because I was able to build out a solution
 and get a really strong feeling for its correctness before I dove in and did the implementation.
 (Honestly it may have overall taken longer to start in c first, but it did FEEL longer)

 It gave me a strong structure to start with which I liked and allowed me to just bypass any "writer's block" or
 distractions I might have had with minor c details starting in c. In that way I think it was less risky
 time-wise to start an implementation in python first.

 "Computer-runnable pseudo-code" <- I definitely got that impression. I was also able to get a sense of what my
 data structures should look like while running so that was a huge plus while debugging.
